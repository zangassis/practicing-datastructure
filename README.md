# Practicing Data Structures with ASP.NET Core 💻

This project contains a sample ASP.NET Core app. This app is an example of the article I produced for the Telerik Blog (telerik.com/blogs).

Welcome to the "Practicing Data Structures" repository! 

In this project, you will find a hands-on guide to learning and implementing essential data structures like Array, Linked List, Stack, and Queue using ASP.NET Core. 🚀

## 📁 Repository Contents

- **📂 Program.cs**: Contains the ASP.NET Core Minimal API project where you can explore and practice data structures.

## 💡 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zangassis/practicing-datastructure
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd practicing-datastructures/
```

3. Run the project:

```bash
dotnet run
```

4. All results will be shown in the terminal
